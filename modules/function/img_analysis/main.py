"""
Cloud Function to be triggered by cloud storage event from image_handler_tr bucket.
Processes the images by checking against google Vision AI dataset and then if non-violent send Pub/Sub message.
All images analysis details are inserted in db "mongodb" and collection "violence_score". You could change names in lines 69-70.
Create db and collection when new documented is inserted.
